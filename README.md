67-443: Protocol Oriented Programming
---
This is the code for the class demo.  Open up the OOPSwift workspace to have all the playgrounds together.  For POP, we started with the `Protocols and Extensions` playground and then went to `POP` (The `Doctors and Surgeons` provides more examples if you want to look at that as well.)

In addition, I created some more playgrounds to illustrate functional programming concepts.  Of particular note is the `flatmap_examples` where we use `compactMap()` to unwrap optionals safely and toss out any nil values automatically.
